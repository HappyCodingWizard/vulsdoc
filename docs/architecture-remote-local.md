Vuls has two modes of setup methods: [remote scan mode](architecture-remote-scan.md) and [local scan mode](architecture-local-scan.md).
Remote scan mode connect to the scan target server via SSH and scan by issuing some commands. On the other hand, Local scan mode does not via SSH, but it runs commands directly on the local host for scanning.
